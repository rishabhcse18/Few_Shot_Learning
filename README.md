# Few-Shot Learning: Training with Limited Data

This repository explores **Few-Shot Learning (FSL)**, a paradigm in machine learning that enables models to generalize from a handful of examples. Built upon advanced mathematical concepts, this project bridges theory and practice, providing solutions for data-scarce scenarios in critical domains like healthcare, robotics, and traffic monitoring.  

The repository encapsulates findings and resources from my **M.Tech colloquium**, offering a deep dive into FSL methodologies, implementation strategies, and domain-specific applications.

## **Highlights**

### **Mathematical Foundations**  
Few-Shot Learning derives its power from robust mathematical models. Here’s a breakdown of the key methodologies:  

#### **1. Prototypical Networks**  
Prototypical Networks create a "prototype" for each class by calculating the mean of all embeddings. Classification is performed based on the distance between an input embedding and these prototypes:  
**d(x, p_c) = ∣∣f(x) − f(p_c)∣∣²**  
Where:  
- **x**: Input data point.  
- **p_c**: Prototype of class **c** (mean of embeddings for that class).  
- **f(x)**: Embedding function (e.g., a neural network).  

Advantages:  
- Computational efficiency.  
- Strong performance with minimal data.

#### **2. Meta-Learning (MAML)**  
Meta-Learning, specifically Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), trains a model to learn how to adapt to new tasks quickly. The core idea is to optimize for generalization across tasks:  
**θ′ = θ − α∇θ L_train**  
Where:  
- **θ**: Model parameters.  
- **α**: Learning rate.  
- **L_train**: Loss function over a specific task.  

MAML’s adaptability makes it a powerful approach for domains with varying objectives.

#### **3. Siamese Networks**  
Siamese Networks focus on learning similarity measures directly. By training a pair of inputs, the network outputs a similarity score, enabling classification based on closeness:  
**Similarity(a, b) = (a · b) / (∥a∥ ∥b∥)**  
Where:  
- **a, b**: Feature vectors of two inputs.  
- **·**: Dot product.  
- **∥a∥, ∥b∥**: Vector magnitudes.  

Applications:  
- One-shot image recognition.  
- Signature verification.
